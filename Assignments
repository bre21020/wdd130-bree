Well, we're supposed to have 3 of us, but there's only 2. So here's what I'm thinking:

Both of the child pages are practically identical, so how about one of us makes the home page, and the other makes a child page, then duplicates the file and updates the onscreen info. How does that sound?

alternatively, if you want to make things a little more complicated, we can have whoever makes the home page be in charge of updating the duplicated child page, even out the workload a little bit. I don't mind either way.

please let me know which division of labor you would prefer:

Option 1: One of us does the home page, the other does both child pages

Option 2: One of does one of the child pages, and the other does the home page, and is in charge of updating the second child page




please update this file by writing your name next to the option you want, and the page you want to work on:

Option 1 <your name here>

Option 2 <your name here>

Home Page <your name here>

Child Page <your name here>


if this file is not updated by the start of next class, I will decide for you. just figured I would give you the option now if you wanted it.
